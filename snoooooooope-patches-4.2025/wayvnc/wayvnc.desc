[I] A VNC server for wlroots based Wayland compositors

[T] This is a VNC server for wlroots-based Wayland compositors (Gnome, KDE
[T] and Weston are not supported). It attaches to a running Wayland session,
[T] creates virtual input devices, and exposes a single display via the RFB
[T] protocol. The Wayland session may be a headless one, so it is also
[T] possible to run wayvnc without a physical display attached.
